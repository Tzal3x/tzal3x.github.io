                    A LoRaWAN setup tale of spring 2024
                </h2>
                <p>
                <h3> Prolog </h3>
                    Late of autumn 2024, year of the dragon, company off-site. While
                    scratching our heads to get an idea to implement during a
                    hackathon, a colleague of mine introduced me to the world of
                    LoRa and LoRaWAN.
                    <br />
                    For those new to IoT (like me), here is TL;DR to save you
                    some clicks:

                    <blockquote>
                        <b>LoRa</b> is the radio signal that carries the data - i.e. a physical layer.
                        <br />
                        <b>LoRaWAN</b> is the communication protocol that defines how that data
                        is sent across the network - i.e. a transport layer.
                    </blockquote>

                    The idea was simple, yet fresh: make a PoC to prove that it's possible
                    to make blockchain transactions over a LoRaWAN network.
                    <br />
                    The solution would consist of two steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Setup a simple LoRaWAN network with an end-node and gateway. </li>
                        <li> Create a flow of creating, signing and executing a transaction to the blockchain. </li>
                    </ol>
                    We got so excited that my jet lag vanished, but  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy's law</a>
                    did us dirty: <i>"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."</i>
                    <br/>
                    We ordered the equipment and waited for it to be delivered.
                    And we waited... We waited... until no time remained, so we
                    dropped the idea and continued working on something else.
                    The so-anticipated harware arrived the last day of the hackathon,
                    which was obviously too late. We decided to get the equipment back to our
                    home-offices and start working on it when our capacity allowed it.
                    </p>
                    The offsite ended, I returned to Athens, and got back to my projects at the time which demanded a lot of our time
                    and there was no space for any experimentation.
                    I still had an itch though. Something that revolved around my mind and I would constantly get back to when
                    daydreaming about project ideas.
                    What if I made the first steps of the implementation?
                    I had a hard time seeing all those goodies just laying around
                    on the shelf. So I decided to give it a go.
                    How hard could it be? I just wanted to set up a single-node network plus send
                    the hex encoded bytecode of a transaction. "Piece of cake!". "Low hanging fruit!"
                    And other deceptions. I would soon be very surprised.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <h3> Equipment </h3>
                    Let's start from the equipment: I was supplied with
                    <ul>
                        <li> (2) <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pis 4b</a>
                        <li> (1) <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2245-Pi-HAT/Overview/#product-description">RAK2245 Pi HAT WisLink LPWAN Concentrator</a>
                        <li> (1) <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3178">Adafruit Feather M0 RFM95 LoRa Radio</a>
                        <li> (1) <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4074">Adafruit LoRa Radio Bonnet with OLED - RFM95W</a>
                        <li> Some other peripherals like TX/TR and GPS antennas.
                    </ul>
                    The RAK2245 HAT could be added on top of a Raspberry Pi 4b to create the gateway.

                    Then, to create an end node I could either setup it up using the feather-RFM95 (standalone) or
                    attach the RFM95W bonnet on top of a raspberry pi to create another one.

                    The RFM95W bonnet could not fit on top of a Raspberrypi 4b because the headers of the board
                    would mismatch the board. So I had to order an additional Raspberrypi zero wh as shown in the
                    adafruit's setup guide.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    And the LoRa odyssey begins!
