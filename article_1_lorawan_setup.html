                    A LoRaWAN setup tale of spring 2024
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Late of autumn 2024, year of the dragon, company off-site. While
                    scratching our heads to get an idea to implement during a
                    hackathon, a colleague of mine introduced me to the world of
                    LoRa and LoRaWAN.
                    <br />
                    For those new to IoT (like me), here is TL;DR to save you
                    some clicks:

                    <blockquote>
                        <b>LoRa</b> is the radio signal that carries the data - i.e. a physical layer.
                        <br />
                        <b>LoRaWAN</b> is the communication protocol that defines how that data
                        is sent across the network - i.e. a transport layer.
                    </blockquote>

                    We got so excited that my jet lag vanished. We ordered the
                    equipment and waited for it to be delivered.
                    And we waited... We waited... until no time remained, so we
                    dropped the idea and continued working on something else.
                    The so-anticipated harware arrived the last day of the hackathon,
                    which was obviously too late. We decided to get the equipment back to our
                    home-offices and start working on it when our capacity allowed it.
